### Introduction and the project structure: 

The following project will consist of 3 sets\n: 
1. Pure React package (that's why I resigned from the Next.ts)
2. Simple documentation landing page for the above package
3. (Maybe) Dedicated backend server to transfer and contain all of the needed files for the client


All of the above will create a single and elegant ecosystem for the product I'm trying to create here. More info and designs are going to be added here, in the README accordingly to the project's progress. Stay tuned! ðŸŽ‰
